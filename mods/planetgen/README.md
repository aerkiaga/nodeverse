# Planetgen
Planetgen is a Minetest mod that generates multiple areas with completely
different terrain, called 'planets'. These can be located anywhere in the world,
in any size. While a default setup with small floating planets everywhere is
provided, it's easy to modify this, as is to control planet generation from
other mods.

## Making changes
If you want to edit the provided default settings (e.g. to generate a single
infinite planet, or multiple planets stacked vertically), or you want to
contribute changes to the mod, read `init.lua`. It will explain everything and
guide you through the code.
